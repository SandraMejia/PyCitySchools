    " * Counterintuitively, a larger School Spending per Student, does not mean a better student performance. On the contrary, schools with the least spending (<\\\\$600/Student) consistently outperformed all other Spending Ranges, including the highest (>\\\\$650/Student).\n",
    " * Similarly, smaller schools consistently outperformed medium- and large-sized ones by a significant margin (for example, look at the % Math Passing rate (94 vs 66%).\n",
    " * Charter schools performed significantly better in all categories, when compared to district schools. This trend is also observable when looking at the Top-Performing and Bottom-Performing schools. The five schools at the top are Charter Schools, while the five at the bottom are District Schools.\n"
